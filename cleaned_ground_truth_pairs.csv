What are the considerations for using niraparib plus abiraterone in patients with mCRPC and a BRCA mutation?,"Niraparib plus abiraterone (combination tablet) is a treatment option for patients with mCRPC and a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (germline and/or somatic) who have not yet had treatment in the setting of mCRPC, depending on prior treatment in other disease settings (PROS-16). Use of niraparib/abiraterone for those who have received prior novel hormone therapy is controversial because a benefit of this combination over use of a PARP inhibitor alone has not been shown in this setting, but responses are likely. The fine-particle (category 2B; other recommended option) or standard formulation of abiraterone can be given with single-agent niraparib as a substitute for the combination niraparib/abiraterone tablet (category 2B; other recommended option)."

What is recommended to prevent rebound bone loss after stopping denosumab therapy?,it is recommended to administer at least one dose of a potent bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid 4 or 5 mg) to prevent rebound bone loss
What is the effect of longer-interval versus standard dosing of zoledronic acid on skeletal events in patients with bone metastases?,"Himelstein AL, Foster JC, Khatcheressian JL, et al. Effect of longer-interval vs standard dosing of zoledronic acid on skeletal events in patients with bone metastases: a randomized clinical trial. JAMA 2017;317:48-58."
What imaging techniques are used for anatomic and functional evaluation in prostate cancer according to the NCCN Guidelines?,"Anatomic imaging techniques include ultrasound, CT, and MRI. Functional imaging techniques include radionuclide bone scan, PET/CT, and advanced MRI techniques, such as spectroscopy and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)."
What is the Will Rogers effect in the context of prostate cancer treatment?,"When patients with the worst prognosis move from one risk group to the higher risk group, the average outcome of both risk groups will improve even if treatment has no impact on disease. This phenomenon is known as the Will Rogers effect, in which the improved outcomes of both groups could be falsely attributed to improvement in treatment, but would be due only to improved risk group assignment."
What are the options for confirmatory testing in active surveillance for prostate cancer?,"Options for confirmatory testing include prostate biopsy, mpMRI with calculation of PSA density (and repeat biopsy as indicated), and/or molecular tumor analysis.
